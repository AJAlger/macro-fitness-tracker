       <p>Lebowski ipsum just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball. Fuckin' A. We wanted to talk about little Larry. May we come in? Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? Yeah man, it really tied the room together. I'll get you a toe by this afternoon —with nail polish. There's no fucking reason—here's my point, Dude—there's no fucking reason.

        <p>We know it's his fucking homework, Walter! Where's the fucking money, you little brat? Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides. I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii. Wait in the car, Donny. That wasn't her toe. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam—.

        <p>Shut the fuck up, Donny. Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax —YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST! Look, Larry… Have you ever heard of Vietnam? Does the Pope shit in the woods? You make everything a fucking travesty! I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC and bowling.

        <p>And let's also not forget—let's not forget, Dude—that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for domestic, you know, within the city —that isn't legal either. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! Shomer shabbos. That guy treats objects like women, man. Beaver? You mean vagina? —I mean, you know him? Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man— what's in it for the Dude?
